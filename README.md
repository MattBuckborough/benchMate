that manages a road hockey league.
## League Rules 
- Games are 20 minutes long.
  - If tied after 20 minutes, there is a sudden death period with no time limit.
- There are no teams
  - When two players are scheduled to play, they are the captains, and do a ‘schoolyard
pick’ of the other players present.
  - Coin flip for home ‘ice’ (first pick)
  - The win or loss goes only to the captains of each team.
- If there are not enough goalies, players must hit the post on the empty net to score a goal.

  - Win = 2 points
